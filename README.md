# Genomic Data Integration Project

## Overview

The Genomic Data Integration Project is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate the integration, management, and analysis of genomic data. Leveraging data from reputable sources such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases, the project aims to provide researchers and bioinformaticians with a powerful toolset for exploring genetic relationships, identifying patterns, and gaining insights into complex biological processes.

## Features

- **Integration of NCBI Data:** Seamlessly integrate genomic data from NCBI's nucleotide and protein databases.
- **Gene-Protein Linking:** Establish a secondary database linking genes to proteins, enabling comprehensive analysis of genetic information.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive user interface for easy navigation and data exploration.
- **Educational Integration:** Features supporting integration into bioinformatics courses and educational programs for hands-on learning experiences.
- **Collaboration:** Foster collaboration among researchers by providing tools for data sharing, collaborative analyses, and discussions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayooludipe/genomic-data-integration.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd genomic-data-integration
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
